Introduction:

This Streamlit app is designed to predict visa acceptance based on input parameters using an XGBoost classifier. The app allows users to upload their dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, make predictions, and display the predicted visa status along with accuracy.


1. Environment Setup:
   - Make sure Python is installed on your system.
   - Install required libraries:
     bash
     pip install streamlit pandas xgboost scikit-learn
     

2. Download Dataset:
   - Users should prepare their dataset in CSV format containing visa-related information, including case IDs and case status.
 Usage
1. Run the App:
   - Open the Streamlit app script (e.g., app.py) in your code editor.
   - Import necessary libraries and define preprocessing and training functions:
     python
     import streamlit as st
     import pandas as pd
     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
     from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
     from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
     from xgboost import XGBClassifier
     from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
     
   - Define the preprocess_data function to handle preprocessing steps like handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
   - Define the train_and_predict function to train the XGBoost model and make predictions.
   - Create the main function to run the Streamlit app, including file upload, data preprocessing, model training, prediction display, and accuracy evaluation.

2. Run the App:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing your Streamlit app script.
   - Run the Streamlit app using the command:
     bash
     streamlit run app.py
     

3. Use the App:*
   - Access the app via your web browser (typically at http://localhost:8501).
   - Upload your CSV dataset containing visa-related information.
   - The app will preprocess the data, train the XGBoost model, make predictions, and display the predicted visa status along with accuracy.
